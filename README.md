This project demonstrates SQL skills and techniques used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. It involves setting up a retail sales database, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and answering business-related questions using SQL queries. The project helps in understanding how SQL can be used to extract insights from data and build a strong foundation in data analysis.

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Set up a retail sales database and import the sales data into it.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the data by finding and removing records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand sales patterns and trends in the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL queries to answer business questions and generate useful insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

**Database Creation**: Created a database named retail_db to store and manage retail sales data. <br>**Database Selection**: Used the USE retail_db command to work within the database. <br>**Table Creation**: Created a table named retail_sales containing fields such as transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, COGS, and total sale amount.  <br>**Data Import**: Imported the retail sales dataset into the retail_sales table for analysis and reporting.  <br>**Data Verification**: Verified that the data was successfully loaded and ready for further analysis.

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**:Identify the total number of unique customers.
- **Category Count**:List all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Detect and remove records with missing or null values.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05**:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

2. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022**:

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE
    category = 'Clothing'
    AND
    TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
    AND
    quantity >= 4
```

3. **Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.**:

```sql
SELECT
    category,
    SUM(total_sale) as net_sale,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1
```

4. **Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.**:

```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(age), 2) as avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty'
```

5. **Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000
```

6. **Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.**:

```sql
SELECT
    category,
    gender,
    COUNT(*) as total_trans
FROM retail_sales
GROUP
    BY
    category,
    gender
ORDER BY 1
```

7. **Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year**:

```sql
SELECT
       year,
       month,
    avg_sale
FROM
(
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) as year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) as month,
    AVG(total_sale) as avg_sale,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) as rank
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1, 2
) as t1
WHERE rank = 1
```

8. **Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales **:

```sql
SELECT
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_sale) as total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5
```

9. **Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.**:

```sql
SELECT
    category,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as cnt_unique_cs
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category
```

10. **Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)**:

```sql
WITH hourly_sale
AS
(
SELECT *,
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END as shift
FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT
    shift,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM hourly_sale
GROUP BY shift
```

## Findings

- **Customer Demographics**: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing and Beauty.
- **High-Value Transactions**: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
- **Customer Insights**: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.

## Reports

- **Sales Summary**: A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.
- **Trend Analysis**: Insights into sales trends across different months and shifts.
- **Customer Insights**: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category.

## Conclusion

This project helped me gain practical experience in SQL by working with retail sales data. It involved database creation, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and solving business problems using SQL queries. Through this project, I analyzed sales trends, customer purchasing behavior, and product performance to generate meaningful business insights and strengthen my data analysis skills.
